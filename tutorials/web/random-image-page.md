# Random Image Page Tutorial

### Scope

## Step 1 - Setup

Our first task is to create a folder in which to store our project. To do this we can just create a new folder with a name of your choice. 

Now we can download the images and extract the zip into a folder called images in our project folder. 

**Note: Please check that the images are not in a subfolder within the images folder. If they are move them into the images folder.**
