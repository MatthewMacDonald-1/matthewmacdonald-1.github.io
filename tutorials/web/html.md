# HTML Basics

What is HTML? HTML stands for hyper text markup language and is a tree style collection of nodes that define the layout of the page. 

Below is an example of what the base of a document typically looks like. The body is where elements like text, images, buttons are found whilst the header (head) is where metadata about the page is located, this includes the title seen in tab bars as well as links to scripts and style sheets. 

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Header -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Body -->
    </body>
</html>
(% endhighlight %)
